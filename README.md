# About
As a tech enthusiast, I have always seen software as not only just hundreds of lines of code but also tried to evaluate the impact that it has on business and hundreds of people's life. Because of which, I have not limited my knowledge to just development but also planning, delivery and reliability assurance. This journey has led me currently to explore the Devops space and pro-actively improve myself and the team's capability of delivering robust software application.

In the past 2-3 years of my DevOps Journey so far:
- Proficient in Linux administration, writing bash scripts & Jenkins pipeline.
- Proficient in CI/CD (Git, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Terraform, Nexus Repository).
- Proficient in AWS Services (EKS, ECS, Elastic Beanstalk, Cloud Formation, VPC, IAM, EC2, ELB, RDS, etc.)
- Logging & Monitoring (ELK, APM, Grafana & Prometheus) metrics such as Latency, Error rates, Resource usage, etc.
- Responsible for Jenkins uptime, scalability & maintenance (via kube agents) 
- Setup and maintain k8s in AWS via EKS as well as kOps.
- Setup and maintain cluster autoscaling efficiently via HPA, Cluster Autoscaler, Karpenter.
- Setup and maintain High Availability Multi-AZ environments.

Before I was a Devops I have spent over 5 years as a Full Stack Developer:
- Working extensively in stack like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Java, PHP, Postgres, MySQL.
- Well versed in Object Oriented programming (OOP), Clean Code, Design Patterns and SOLID
 Principles and Test Driven Development (TDD).
- Web-development using Frameworks and CMS (Spring Boot, Laravel, Lumen, Angular, CodeIgniter, Wordpress).
- Experienced in payment gateway integration (Paypal, Authorize.net, Worldpay, Stripe).
- Agile follower and practitioner (Scrum, Kanban, Scrumban, JIRA, Trello)
- Develop & document RESTful APIs (Swagger, Postman)
- Mentionable third party APIs, libraries & tools (Google Maps API, JQuery, Pusher, Websockets, Sentry Application Monitoring & Error Tracking)
- Hands on experience with microservice based architecture design, development and deployment.
