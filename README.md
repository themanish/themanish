Experienced Senior Platform Engineer with a strong background in DevOps, software engineering, and site reliability, currently driving development of internal developer portal to improve DevEx. Over 8+ years in tech (4+ in SRE/DevOps), Iâ€™ve led the design and implementation of high-availability systems, optimized infrastructure cost and performance, and reduced operational toil through automation and standardization.

I have architected and maintained scalable clusters on AWS (ECS, EKS, kOps) in a domain driven multi-account setup, implemented autoscaling strategies (ASG, HPA, Karpenter), and led CI/CD modernisation using Terraform and GitHub Actions. I also developed internal platforms like a developer portal to improve DevEx and accelerate team velocity, treating platforms as products with measurable impact.

My foundation as a full stack engineer (JavaScript, Angular, Java, Spring Boot) allows me to deeply understand developer pain points and collaborate effectively to improve reliability, latency, and operational efficiency. I embrace observability, with hands-on experience in ELK and NewRelic to drive proactive incident response and SLOs/SLAs.
